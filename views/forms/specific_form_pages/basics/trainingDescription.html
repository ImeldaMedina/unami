                            needs to find a location for the classes and take care of advertising and publicity. You
                            will be required to send periodic reports to State and National for their recordkeeping and
                            upload data into the National NAMI Education Data tracking program. The classes involve
                            reading aloud from NAMI course materials so applicants need to be comfortable with this.
