                            To be a successful NAMI Homefront teacher, you need to respond to others in a non-judgmental
                            way, you need to be a good listener with an empathetic ear, you need to be willing to talk
                            about your experience as a family member of someone living with a mental illness, and you
                            will need to be a family member of a service member/veteran living with mental illness.

                            Trainees agree to attend the entire class. Trainees must demonstrate the qualifications
                            needed to become a good NAMI teacher by the end of training. Trainees may be asked to
                            improve their skills in particular key areas and repeat the training before they may become
                            certified. All applicants will participate in a phone screening interview with the class
                            leaders prior to being accepted into the class. Minimum age to become a Homefront teacher is
                            18 years old.

                            You will need to register and interview all prospective students before the class. Each
                            weekly
                            class requires a lot of pre-class preparation. In some affiliates, the teacher also needs to
                            find a location for the classes and take care of advertising and publicity. You will be
                            required
                            to send periodic reports to State and National for their recordkeeping and upload data into

                            National NAMI Education Data tracking program. The classes involve reading aloud from NAMI
                            course materials so applicants need to be comfortable with this.
