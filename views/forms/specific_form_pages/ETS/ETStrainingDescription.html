                    It is recommended that Affiliates participate in this training only if they have a fully formed
                    team of 2-people, as indicated above, otherwise the Affiliate will not be able to implement the
                    program.</p>

                    <li>A team includes a young adult (age 18-35) living with mental illness willing to share their

                    <li>Because NAMI Ending the Silence is taught in schools and youth settings, applicant should have

                <p class="lead"><strong>What will you learn at the Ending the Silence (ETS) program?</strong><br>
                    The ETS online training is focused on preparing your draft presentation script and the one-day
                    in-person training will focus on skill development. The online portion could take 6-8 hours to
                    complete. Each trainee will learn to do the following: prepare your story, develop your story, and
                    practice your talk for use at Ending the Silence presentations in your community. Two presenters
                    speak at each presentation.</p>

                    NAMI Washington will pay for meals, snacks, lodging and all training materials.
                    Your NAMI affiliate is asked to cover your travel and other expenses that you may incur to attend
                    this training.  Lodging is at the Comfort Inn and is double occupancy.  If you require single
                    occupancy, arrangements will need to be made prior to attendance,  and there will be additional
                    costs which will be the responsibility of the attendee. Attending the training is by
                    pre-registration only, and class size is limited. If there are more applications than spots for
                    the class a waiting list will be created.  In order to reserve a space a $50 refundable
                    registration deposit from your affiliate is required at the time of registration.
                    Completion of the online training is REQUIRED for in-person training attendance – if you do not
                    complete the online training you will be unable to attend the in-person training. If you need to
                    cancel after being accepted, notify Deanna Roy at the state office 206-783-4288 or droy@namiwa.org
                    no later than January 28, 2019 so we can fill your spot, or your affiliate will lose its $50
                    registration deposit.  Since this is a team program, cancelled spots can be filled with another
                    member of the Affiliate who would fulfill the team spot.</p>
