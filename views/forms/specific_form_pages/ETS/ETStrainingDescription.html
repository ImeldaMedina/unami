                            in your community. Two presenters speak at each presentation.

                            training.  Lodging is at the Comfort Inn and is double occupancy.  If you require single
                            occupancy, arrangements will need to be made prior to attendance,  and there will be
                            additional costs which will be the responsibility of the attendee. Attending the training
                            is by pre-registration only, and class size is limited. If there are more applications than
                            spots for the class a waiting list will be created.  In order to reserve a space a $50
                            refundable registration deposit from your affiliate is required at the time of registration.
                            Completion of the online training is REQUIRED for in-person training attendance – if you do
                            not complete the online training you will be unable to attend the in-person training.
                            If you need to cancel after being accepted, notify Deanna Roy at the state office
                            206-783-4288 or droy@namiwa.org no later than January 28, 2019 so we can fill your spot,
                            or your affiliate will lose its $50 registration deposit.  Since this is a team program,
                            cancelled spots can be filled with another member of the Affiliate who would fulfill the
                            team spot.
